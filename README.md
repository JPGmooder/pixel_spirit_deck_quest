### Set of realizations of completed pixel deck's tasks

**The PixelSpirit Elements Deck** is a tarot deck for learning GLSL shaders. 
Each PixelSpirit card has a visual element and its GLSL shader code, so each folder contains completed task of specific card. 
The cards are ordered from simplest to most complex, building a library of code functions that combine like a book of spells to form an infinite visual language. This deck is a tool for learning, a library, and an oracle.
In the 50 cards of this deck you will find the 22 major arcana â€” the ancestral archetypes of the traditional Tarot deck. The wisdom of these powerful cards will guide you on your shader journey.

> I found these cards thanks to the book "Book of shaders", as part of learning how to create shapes using GLSL. If you want to start learning GLSL shaders, I recommend this [source][book].
